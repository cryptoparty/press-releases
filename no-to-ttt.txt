NOTICE: this is not the final version of the press release and is not suitable for publishing.

We see the necessity to publish this statement due to attempts to seize our movement by certain organizations associated with companies and powers that do clearly not share the goals of our movement.
The aim of our movement is to provide people with the knowledge to protect themselves against any kind of surveillance and control through both commercial and governmental powers.
We want to provide information free of cost to all people, allowing those people to use and spread tools to encrypt their communication on various channels in ordner to protect their privacy, and to allow for their self-fulfilment without observation or supervision.
We believe that only non-proprietary, open source software is one of the keys to ensure a certain, high degree of security in software.
We further state that we ourselves select with whom we co-operate, based on the principles listed above. 
We will stay free of any unwanted support or attempts to overtake us by organizations, political parties or companies. 
We ourselves, as an equal organization with to official hierarchy will decide whether their support is a benefit for our movement or not, and we will act accordingly.
